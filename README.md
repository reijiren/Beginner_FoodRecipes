# FoodRecipes

This is my Beginner Backend Project from PijarCamp

This Project is to make an API using Express JS Framework to receive data from database, show the data, update and delete the data.

Here is the full flow of the application, from user login until user logout

The requirements:
 - Database Connection (using 'pg' module)
 - Secure the credentials of the database (using 'dotenv' module)
 - CRUD
 - Search user by email, and search recipe by title
 - Sort data
 - Pagination
 - Error handling (try catch)
 - Linter, to analyze the code (using eslint)
 - Postman Documentation
